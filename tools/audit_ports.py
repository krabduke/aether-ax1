"""Every port is connected.

    python3 tools/audit_ports.py            (runs itself under Blender)
    python3 tools/audit_ports.py --shrink   (after a fix: drop what is fixed)

The other audits ask whether parts overlap, touch and form circuits. None of
them asks whether the end of a hose is on anything, or whether a plug has a
cable in it -- and a part touches the assembly through its other end, so a
cable that stops in the air beside its plug passes all of them.

Every mesh.pipe end the parts are built with -- hose, line, cable, loom -- must
run into something: material, or a surface within 2.5 mm, 3 mm past its cap.
Every shapes.connector housing must have a pipe ending in or against it.

FREE names the ends that are free by design -- an exhaust's exit, a
dipstick's handle, a blanking cover's face -- each with the reason.
OPEN lists what is known to be open. It only gets shorter: anything new fails,
and anything fixed fails until --shrink drops it. --shrink never adds.
